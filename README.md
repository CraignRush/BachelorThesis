### Abstract
Droplet microfluidics - although invented in the early 1990s - receives growing attention
due to its various applications in preclinical and clinical environment. In the last years,
nano- to picoliter encapsulation of immiscible fluids have been successfully developed
from nutrient analysis to single cell sequencing. Precise control over the droplet volume
and manipulation of the contents in laminar flow are only some advantages over
conventional turbulent systems. However, most of these biochemical analyses rely on
luminescence or fluorescence output and therefore on a costly optical readout.
As a contrary approach of scientists, the Giant-Magneto-Resistance technology (formerly
used in hard drive storage) was implemented into Silicon-Polymer microfluidics as
a non-optical and robust device for single cell analysis, where fast and accurate electrical
readout instruments are easily available. Magnetic sensing offers nearly backgroundfree
readout due to negligible magnetic background in biological samples. Contrary to
luminescence and fluorescence techniques, specimen are immunologically tagged with
magnetic particles to show the desired results. Furthermore, magnetophoretic forces
allow for precise manipulation and sorting of labeled cellular targets.
The aim of this thesis is to investigate a droplet-based and label-free approach for single
cell analysis in magnetic flow cytometry. Contrary to measuring the accumulation
of magnetic particles on a biological target, this work aims at a label free approach.
Therefore, plain magnetic nanoparticles shall be brought into a droplet together with
one or more cells. Via displacement of magnetic momentum and the resulting change
in electric signal, then an accurate assertion about shape and size of the cell can be
made. Furthermore, the encapsulation of single cells and functionalized magnetic particles
potentially allows to study binding characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles at the
single cell level.
First, a MATLAB simulation for various particle distributions in plug droplets and their
characteristic signal will be created and evaluated. Second, the outcome is verified
under real conditions with self-designed and -manufactured microfluidic channels. Designs
for droplet generation are implemented for experimental investigation of numerical
results. Droplet microfluidics are integrated with magnetic sensors and the optical as
well as the magnetic readout is analyzed with home-made algorithms. Last, optical and
electrical readout are to be postprocessed via MATLAB again.
